# We All Die

> *"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."* â€” Psalm 90:12 (NIV)

Welcome to **We All Die**, the first (as far as I know, as of 14MAR2025) web-based life calendar to visualize the lifespans of **two** people in weeksâ€”past, present, and future. This tool encourages thoughtful reflection on the time weâ€™re given, with a unique focus on shared and individual journeys.

## How to Use

1. **Open the App**: Load `index.html` in your browserâ€”no installation required.
2. **Enter Details for Two People**:
   - For **Person 1** and **Person 2**:
     - Select their **birth dates**
     - Choose their **biological sex**
     - Check "Show Person 1" and/or "Show Person 2" to include them
3. **Generate Your Calendar**: Click "Generate Calendar" to view the combined timeline:
4. **Explore** by hovering over weeks for age and date details
5. **Save** as an image with "Save as Image".

## Using the Tool

This app provides an opportunity to reflect on time as a finite resource:
- **Pray and Listen**: Take a moment to consider what matters most.
- **Reflect**: Think about how your days are spent, alone or together.
- **Plan**: Look for ways to make the most of your time.

Itâ€™s also a unique tool for **relationship building**â€”whether for couples, friends, or familyâ€”offering a visual way to appreciate shared seasons and plan meaningful moments ahead.

## Note

- **Life Expectancy Data**: Based on simplified US statistics (males: average 76, median 78; females: average 81, median 83). These are estimates, not guarantees.
- **Calendar Span**: Starts from the earlier birth year and extends 90 years beyond the later birth, as a practical framework.
